# Goal
Chinese banks are very risk-averse, yet younger generations are more willing to take on debt at similar rates to other developed countries. What are the contributing factors to a credit card holder defaulting on debt? How can we know if an account will default 6 months into the future? That is what we aim to find out! We will accomplish this by looking for patterns in user's credit history and application data, with a watchful eye to ethical consideration.

This project will contain
* A [Jupyter Notebook]() - needs link
* A 5 minute [presentation] needs link 
* A [data dictionary](#data-dictionary) (linked below)
